The Eleventy ecosystem is *huge*! There are [official and community](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/) starters for almost any Glitch project you can dream up.

The best part is, no matter what starter you use, as long as you set your eleventy app to [generated static site](https://help.glitch.com/kb/article/111-what-is-eleventy-11ty-and-how-can-i-use-it-on-glitch/), you'll be able to take advantage of the feature on Glitch!

* Right now, your site is **live on the web**, with a real URL (a secure HTTPS address ðŸ”’) that updates as soon as you make changes to your site or app.

> ðŸ’¡ In the Glitch editor, click your project name in the top left, and in the menu that opens, select the name and type a new one. Your project will be live at the new address instantly.

* **Add a domain** to your new Glitch project! Just go to the **Tools** menu in the Glitch editor, and click on **Custom Domains**.
* Use the **Share** button in the editor to invite others in to edit your new Eleventy project by typing in their email or Glitch username.

> ðŸ’¡ Make your code, or even your entire app, private to just those you invite, by [upgrading your Glitch account](https://glitch.com/pricing).

* Use a **full-powered Linux command line** to manage your new Glitch project. Go to the **Tools** menu in the Glitch editor, and click **Terminal** to peek under the hood.

There are lots of [Eleventy plugins](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/) you can also add to your project.

Some additional developments to try:
* Add a UI library like [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* Use the [Eleventy image library](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/) to optimize your blog images
