<p>This is your first blog post in eleventy! Written entirely in markdown, this page will update as you write in the markdown editor.</p>
<h1>Star Wars</h1>
<p>What's wrong? Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his mind. He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him. I only wish Ben were here. This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new one? Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a lot together. You okay, Artoo? Okay, easy she goes! Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back. You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you? Luke, the Force will be with you.</p>

<p>He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording. H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay. There you go. Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message. What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards! Luke? Luke! Come to dinner! All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru. I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter. Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back. Just you reconsider playing that message for him. No, I don't think he likes you at all. No, I don't like you either.</p>

<p>Are you all right? What's wrong? I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear something terrible has happened. You'd better get on with your exercises. Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I told you I'd outrun 'em. Don't everyone thank me at once. Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours. Now be careful, Artoo. He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you. Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee. But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid. That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that. I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let the Wookiee win.</p>

<p>Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic... Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan... You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her away!</p>
<p>Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be some time before we can extract any information from her. The final check-out is complete. All systems are operational. What course shall we set? Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of persuasion. What do you mean? I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this station. Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet of Alderaan. With pleasure.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape. Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.</p>
